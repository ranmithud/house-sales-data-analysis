# House Sales in King County, USA — Data Analysis Project

This repository contains a data analysis performed on the King County House Sales dataset. The notebook includes data loading, exploratory analysis, visualization, feature–target relationship investigation, and multiple regression model trainings and evaluations. 
I have completed this as part of my IBM Data Science Course.

## Project Objectives

In this project, I have:

1. Loaded and inspected the dataset to understand its structure
2. Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify correlations
3. Visualised distributions and feature relationships using Python plotting libraries
4. Built baseline linear regression models for initial performance benchmarking
5. Applied polynomial regression and pipelines to capture non-linear patterns
6. Evaluated and refined models using train/test splits, cross-validation, and ridge regression
